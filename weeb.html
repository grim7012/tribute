                     Arguably the most beautiful artiste to ever grace the Indian screen,
                     Madhubala rose from humble beginnings to become the most captivating star 
                     India has ever produced. Madhubala was born Mumtaz Jehan Begum on Valentine's Day
                     1933, in a poor, conservative family of Pathan Muslims in Delhi, a part of a 
                     prolific brood of sisters, and entered the world of films at the tender age of eight.
                     Sadly, she was plagued by a persistent heart disease that confined her to a bed for almost
                     nine torturous years, and eventually claimed her life on February 23 1969.
                     In this short life, she had made over 70 movies, and to this day remains one of the most enduring legends of Indian cinema.
                     She ranked as one of the highest-paid entertainers in India in the post-independence era, that coincided with the rise of Indian cinema on global levels. In a career spanning more than 20 years, Madhubala was predominantly active for only a decade but had appeared in over 60 films by the time of her death in 1969.
